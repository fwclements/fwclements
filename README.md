- Hi, Iâ€™m Frank!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in network automation, non-"software developer" development (throwing methods at problems to solve them) and general tinkering with anything technology related - like home automation, linux gaming, etc.  Outside of technology, I enjoy mountain biking, hiking, dirt bikes and sailing.  I have a side kick (border collie) that spends nearly every moment with me.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to leverage tools such as Ansible, Nornir and Salt for automating service provider sized networks.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me here I guess.  As odd as this might be, I don't have any social media profiles as I'm not a fan of giving my personal data and whereabouts up to corporations and the general public.
